A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modem"},"rdfs:label":"Modem","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:NetworkNode"}},{"@id":"d3f:NetworkNode"},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modem"}]},"neighbors":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"},"@graph":[]}}
