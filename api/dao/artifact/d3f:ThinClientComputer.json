The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, performing calculations, and storing data. This contrasts with a fat client or a conventional personal computer; the former is also intended for working in a client-server model but has significant local processing power, while the latter aims to perform its function mostly locally. Thin clients are shared computers as the thin client's computing resources are provided by a remote server.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thin_client"},"rdfs:label":"Thin Client Computer","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:SharedComputer"}},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thin_client"}]},"neighbors":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"},"@graph":[]}}
