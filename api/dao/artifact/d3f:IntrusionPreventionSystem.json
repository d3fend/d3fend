The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it.\n\nIntrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected. IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address. An IPS also can correct cyclic redundancy check (CRC) errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted transport and network layer options.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intrusion_detection_system#Intrusion_prevention"},"rdfs:label":"Intrusion Prevention System","rdfs:seeAlso":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intrusion_detection_system"},"rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:IntrusionDetectionSystem"},"skos:altLabel":["IDPS","Intrusion Detection and Prevention System","IPS"]},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intrusion_detection_system"},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intrusion_detection_system#Intrusion_prevention"}]},"neighbors":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"},"@graph":[]}}
