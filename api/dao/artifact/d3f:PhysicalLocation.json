The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, which often indicates an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry. The distinction between space and place is considered a central concern of geography, and has been addressed by scholars such as Yi-Fu Tuan and John Agnew.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Location_(geography)"},"rdfs:label":"Physical Location","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:DigitalArtifact"}},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Location_(geography)"}]},"neighbors":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"},"@graph":[{"@id":"d3f:Authentication","d3f:originates-from":[{"@id":"d3f:PhysicalLocation"}],"d3f:outbound":[{"@id":"d3f:originates-from"}],"rdfs:label":["Authentication"]},{"@id":"d3f:NetworkTraffic","d3f:originates-from":[{"@id":"d3f:PhysicalLocation"}],"d3f:outbound":[{"@id":"d3f:originates-from"}],"rdfs:label":["Network Traffic"]},{"@id":"d3f:PhysicalLocation","rdfs:label":["Physical Location"]}]}}
