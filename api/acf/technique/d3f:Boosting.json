This process is continued iteratively until the final prediction is made by aggregating the previous predictions.\n\n## Considerations\nBoosting can be computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and slower to train compared to other ensemble methods.\n\nThere are three main types of Boosting algorithms\n - Adaptive Boosting\nAdaptive Boosting (sometimes called AdaBoost) works by adding equal importance to each piece of a dataset and running it through the base learning algorithms. Every algorithm that errors, the boosting algorithm assigns a higher importance to. This continues until an acceptable level of confidence is reached.\n - Gradient Boosting\nGradient Boosting starts by training multiple models simultaneously to gather a strong estimate of strength to build new base learning algorithms.\n - XGBoosting\nXGBoosting is a scalable tree boosting model. Using decision trees, weight is assigned to each variable and put into a decision tree. Outputs that are classified by the algorithm as wrong or weak are put into a second decision tree and the results form a stronger model.\n\n## References\nSciencedirect. (n.d.).
