The transition probability distribution (or transition model) and the reward function are often collectively called the \"model\" of the environment (or MDP), hence the name \"model-free\". A model-free RL algorithm can be thought of as an \"explicit\" trial-and-error algorithm. An example of a model-free algorithm is Q-learning.","d3f:kb-article":"## References\nModel-free (reinforcement learning). Wikipedia.
