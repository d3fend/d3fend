First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables.","d3f:kb-article":"## How it works\n\nFor propositions such as \"Socrates is a man\", one can have expressions in the form \"there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man\", where \"there exists\" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.\n\nThe term \"first-order\" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Advantages:\n-- First-order logic is more expressive than propositional logic; one can talk about objects and their properties, relations between objects.\n-- First-order logic is able to make use of variables and quantifiers (e.g., \"for all\" and \"exists\".)\n-- First-order logic supports power forms of reasoning, such as inferring the properties of an unknown object from the properties of known objects.\n\n- Disadvantages:\n-- First-order logic is more difficult to learn and use than propositional logic, due to its greater complexity.\n-- First-order logic is also less tractable than propositional logic in many cases; reasoning about quantifiers and variables adds complexity.\n-- First-order logic can be difficult to apply in practice, due to the need to find appropriate axioms and rules for each application.\n\n### Verification Approach\n\n- Automated theorem provers can assist in formal verification, performing automated reasoning over system modeled in first-order logic and explore a complete space of system behaviors\n- First-order logic may be more expressive than necessary for many types of problems and may be more difficult to verify by SMEs.\n- Theorem provers based in FOL are capable of use in software verification tasks, but an SMT solver such as Z3 might be more appropriate.\n- Defining a set of competency questions (i.e., query use cases for a first-order logic ontology) can help scope the logic required for a complete solution.\n\n### Validation Approach\n\n- Domain SMEs should be identified to review the analytics results and compare them to expected results for a given input.\n- Where possible, an outside team of SMEs should inspect the formal logic specification of a system against its stated requirements and suitability to address its domain problem sets.\n- Defining a set of competency questions and the expected results provides one means of validation.\n\n## References\n\n1.
