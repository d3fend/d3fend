Active learning addresses this labeling bottleneck by asking an oracle (e.g., a human annotator) to label selected unlabeled instances. The goal is to achieve high accuracy with minimal labeling effort.\n\n## Considerations\nActive learning is particularly useful in scenarios where data is abundant but labeled instances are scarce or expensive. Examples include speech recognition, information extraction, and document classification.\n\n## References\n- Wikipedia article on Active Learning (machine learning) [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning))\n- Settles, B.
