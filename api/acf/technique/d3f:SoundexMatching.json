The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software. Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms.\n\n## References\n1. Soundex. (2023, April 19). In _Wikipedia_.
