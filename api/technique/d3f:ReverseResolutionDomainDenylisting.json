This technique drops reverse lookup responses where a domain name matches an entry in the blacklist, either verbatim or as a wildcard subdomain of a higher-level domain on the list. Such domain names might be unwanted because Forward Domain Name Resolution requests to such a blacklisted domain might return an unwanted IP address.\n\nThis technique is useful because relying solely on Forward Resolution Domain Blacklisting will miss instances where the domain in question is forward-resolved in a manner that is not inspected via a subsequent technique (as is likely the case if that resolution is performed with DoH (DNS over HTTPS) or DoT (DNS over TLS)). Additionally, note that responses to forward lookups of that domain are *not* necessarily equal to the original IP in the reverse lookup request, and that future lookups of a string based on this domain may even employ a less-common name resolution protocol, such as NBNS.\n\nThe DNS response can either be blocked by dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or by modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server.  To prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values, either with names like \"localhost.\" or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted domain or any IP addresses that it might resolve to, only from learning about this domain name via a nameserver lookup.\n* DNS response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer domain name value(s).\n  * DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.\n  * Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.\n* This technique must be deployed between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.\n  * DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the domain name(s) in the response.\n* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.","d3f:synonym":"Reverse Resolution Domain Blacklisting","rdfs:label":"Reverse Resolution Domain Denylisting","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:DNSDenylisting"}}]},"digital_artifacts":{"head":{"vars":["query_def_tech_label","top_def_tech_label","def_tech_label","def_artifact_rel_label","def_artifact_label","def_tactic","def_tactic_rel","def_tech","def_artifact_rel","def_artifact"]},"results":{"bindings":[{"query_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Reverse Resolution Domain Denylisting"},"top_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Network Isolation"},"def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Reverse Resolution Domain Denylisting"},"def_artifact_rel_label":{"type":"literal","value":"blocks"},"def_artifact_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Inbound Internet DNS Response Traffic"},"def_tactic":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#Isolate"},"def_tactic_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#enables"},"def_tech":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#ReverseResolutionDomainDenylisting"},"def_artifact_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#blocks"},"def_artifact":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#InboundInternetDNSResponseTraffic"}}]}},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]},"related_offensive_matrix":{},"references":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#"},"@graph":[]},"references_meta":{}}
