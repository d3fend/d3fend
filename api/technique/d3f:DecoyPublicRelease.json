The media may include URLs, points of contact, or other identifiers to entice interaction from adversaries.\n\n## Considerations\n* Information used in decoy public released media must contain enough realism to deceive and provide interaction from adversaries.\n* Continuous development, creation, and distribution of media and identifiers are needed to ensure adversary interaction continues over time.\n* Decoy public releases could be placed on platforms with different degrees of ownership, including entirely enterprise-owned infrastructure, IaaS, and SaaS (including social applications).

The user action may be in response to a mock attack delivered via a messaging service, a wireless communication service, a fake malware application or another device, service, system or mechanism. The system selects a training action from a collection of available training actions and causes the training action to be delivered to the user.","d3f:kb-author":"Norman Sadeh-Koniecpol, Kurt Wescoe, Jason Brubaker, Jason Hong","d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"","d3f:kb-organization":"WOMBAT SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES Inc","d3f:kb-reference-of":{"@id":"d3f:DecoyPublicRelease"},"d3f:kb-reference-title":"Mock attack cybersecurity training system and methods","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Mock attack cybersecurity training system and methods - WOMBAT SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES Inc"}]},"references_meta":{"Patent":1},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"},"@graph":[]},"related_offensive_matrix":{}}
