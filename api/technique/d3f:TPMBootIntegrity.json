The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.\n\nAttestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.  The TPM signature is trusted because the private key is stored securely in hardware and never leaves the TPM.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* The TPM does not perform the follow-on actions of acting on the PCR value information, it just provides the PCR stored information.\n* The current version of TPM is 2.0.; most existing implementations use TPM 1.2.\n\n## Citations\n[1] [TPM 2.0 Library](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/)\n[2] [TCG Trusted Attestation Protocol (TAP) Use Cases for TPM Families 1.2 and 2.0 and DICE](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TNC_TAP_Use_Cases_v1r0p35_published.pdf)","d3f:kb-reference":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference-TCGTrustedAttestationProtocolUseCasesForTPMFamilies1.2And2.0AndDICE"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-TPM2.0LibrarySpecification_TrustedComputingGroup,Incorporated"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-TrustedAttestationProtocolUseCases"}],"d3f:synonym":["Static Root of Trust Measurement","STRM"],"rdfs:label":"TPM Boot Integrity","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:PlatformHardening"}}]},"digital_artifacts":{"head":{"vars":["query_def_tech_label","top_def_tech_label","def_tech_label","def_artifact_rel_label","def_artifact_label","def_tactic","def_tactic_rel","def_tech","def_artifact_rel","def_artifact"]},"results":{"bindings":[]}},"references":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#"},"@graph":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference-TCGTrustedAttestationProtocolUseCasesForTPMFamilies1.2And2.0AndDICE","@type":["d3f:SpecificationReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TNC_TAP_Use_Cases_v1r0p35_published.pdf"},"d3f:kb-reference-title":"TCG Trusted Attestation Protocol Use Cases for TPM Families 1.2 and 2.0 and DICE","d3f:reference-type-label":"Specification","rdfs:label":"Reference - TCG Trusted Attestation Protocol Use Cases for TPM Families 1.2 and 2.0 and DICE"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-TPM2.0LibrarySpecification_TrustedComputingGroup,Incorporated","@type":["d3f:SpecificationReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"This specification defines the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) a device that enables trust in computing\nplatforms in general.
