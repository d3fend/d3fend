        "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\nEndpoints are configured to periodically generate and transmit a secure heartbeat that is delivered on a configured schedule and provides endpoint status information. Status information can include software details (version, configuration, etc), endpoint identification (MAC, IP address, machine ID) or other hardware/software configuration information. Interruption of the heartbeat can signal that the endpoint has been compromised.\n\n## Considerations\n* Security of heartbeat messages to ensure message integrity\n* Disappearance of the heartbeat could simply mean that the endpoint is powered off or intentionally disconnected from the network. Therefore other criteria may need to be used to accurately detect endpoint compromise.\n* Attacker presence on the machine may leave the heartbeat intact.\n* An attacker may determine the format of the heartbeat and continue to send it even after the machine is compromised.",

In one aspect, the detection of certain network traffic at a gateway is used to trigger a query of an originating endpoint, which can use internal logs to identify a local process that is sourcing the network traffic. In another aspect, an endpoint is configured to periodically generate and transmit a secure heartbeat, so that an interruption of the heartbeat can be used to signal the possible presence of malware. In another aspect, other information such as local and global reputation information is used to provide context for more accurate malware detection.",

The endpoint health monitor issues a heartbeat for satisfactory status of the endpoint using factors such as:\n\n* checking the status of individual software items executing on the endpoint\n* checking that antivirus and other security software is up to date (e. g., with current virus definition files) and running correctly\n* checking the integrity of cryptographic key stores\n* checking other hardware or software components of the endpoint as necessary or helpful for health monitoring\n\nA disappearance of the heartbeat from the endpoint may indicate that the endpoint has been compromised.",
