It may be located near or in some portion of the enterprise address space, but it does not interact with enterprise resources.\n\n## Considerations\nA standalone honeynet is a lower risk to deploy compared to connected or integrated honeynets due to its isolation from the enterprise network. However, this comes at cost in loss of fidelity and realism. Significant extra effort must be made in order to make the environment look realistic.","d3f:kb-reference":{"@id":"d3f:Reference_DynamicSelectionAndGenerationOfAVirtualCloneForDetonationOfSuspiciousContentWithinAHoneyNetwork_PaloAltoNetworksInc"},"d3f:spoofs":{"@id":"d3f:IntranetNetwork"},"rdfs:label":"Standalone Honeynet","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:DecoyEnvironment"}}]},"digital_artifacts":{"head":{"vars":["query_def_tech_label","top_def_tech_label","def_tech_label","def_artifact_rel_label","def_artifact_label","def_tactic","def_tactic_rel","def_tech","def_artifact_rel","def_artifact"]},"results":{"bindings":[{"query_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Standalone Honeynet"},"top_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Decoy Environment"},"def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Standalone Honeynet"},"def_artifact_rel_label":{"type":"literal","value":"spoofs"},"def_artifact_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Intranet Network"},"def_tactic":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#Deceive"},"def_tactic_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#enables"},"def_tech":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#StandaloneHoneynet"},"def_artifact_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#spoofs"},"def_artifact":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#IntranetNetwork"}},{"query_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Standalone Honeynet"},"top_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Decoy Environment"},"def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Decoy Environment"},"def_artifact_rel_label":{"type":"literal","value":"manages"},"def_artifact_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Decoy Artifact"},"def_tactic":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#Deceive"},"def_tactic_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#enables"},"def_tech":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#DecoyEnvironment"},"def_artifact_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#manages"},"def_artifact":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#DecoyArtifact"}}]}},"references":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#"},"@graph":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference_DynamicSelectionAndGenerationOfAVirtualCloneForDetonationOfSuspiciousContentWithinAHoneyNetwork_PaloAltoNetworksInc","@type":["d3f:PatentReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://patents.google.com/patent/US9882929B1/en?oq=US-9882929-B1"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"Techniques for dynamic selection and generation of detonation location of suspicious content with a honey network are disclosed.
