The system continuously collects, stores, and analyzes forensic data related to the enterprise's network. Based on the analysis, the system is able to determine normal behavior of the network and portions thereof and thereby identify abnormal behaviors within the network. Upon identification of an abnormal behavior, the system determines whether the abnormal behavior relates to a security incident. Upon determining a security incident in any portion of the enterprise's network, the system extracts forensic data respective of the security incident and enables further assessment of the security incident as well as identification of the source of the security incident. The system provides real-time damage assessment respective of the security incident as well as the security incident's attributions.","d3f:kb-author":"Gil BARAK; Shai MORAG","d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"This patent describes detecting abnormal behavior related to a security incident by collecting and analyzing forensic data in real time.
