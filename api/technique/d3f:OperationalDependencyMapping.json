We enhance this scenario with additional mission and operational context, and then build a mission dependency model for the enhanced scenario. It is anticipated that our mission dependency model will be part of an upcoming demonstration of cyber defense situational awareness capabilities in a NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency test environment, integrated with data sources that represent the operational military environment.","d3f:kb-author":"William Heinbockel, Steven Noel, James Curbo","d3f:kb-organization":"JHU APL","d3f:kb-reference-of":{"@id":"d3f:OperationalDependencyMapping"},"d3f:kb-reference-title":"Mission Dependency Modeling for Cyber Situational Awareness","d3f:reference-type-label":"Academic Paper","rdfs:label":"Reference - Mission Dependency Modeling for Cyber Situational Awareness"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-UnifiedArchitectureFrameworkUAF","@type":["d3f:SpecificationReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://www.omg.org/spec/UAF/"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"UAF is an OMG standard that assists in development of architectural descriptions in commercial industry firms, federal government agencies and defense organizations.
