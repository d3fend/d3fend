In Email,  Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to validate sender domain ownership.\n\n### SPF\nSPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.\n### DKIM\nDKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.\n\n### DMARC\nDMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the \"From\" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.\n\n## Considerations\n- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.\n- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.\n- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.\n- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.\n- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.","d3f:kb-reference":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference-DomainKeysIdentifiedMail-Signatures-IETF"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-RFC7208-SenderPolicyFramework-SPF-ForAuthorizingUseOfDomainsInEmail-IETF"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-RFC7489-Domain-basedMessageAuthentication-Reporting-AndConformance-DMARC"}],"rdfs:label":"Transfer Agent Authentication","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:MessageHardening"}}]},"digital_artifacts":{"head":{"vars":["query_def_tech_label","top_def_tech_label","def_tech_label","def_artifact_rel_label","def_artifact_label","def_tactic","def_tactic_rel","def_tech","def_artifact_rel","def_artifact"]},"results":{"bindings":[]}},"references":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#"},"@graph":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference-DomainKeysIdentifiedMail-Signatures-IETF","@type":["d3f:SpecificationReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message.  This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents.  DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message.  Assertion of responsibility is validated through a\ncryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly\nto retrieve the appropriate public key.  Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.","d3f:kb-author":"D. Crocker, T.
