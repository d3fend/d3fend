The switching ASIC has a high-speed memory table which enables it to look up addresses that it has previously obtained and to forward unicast packets to said addresses. The VSE is a CPU that makes switching decisions outside of the ASIC and keeps track of any unknown addresses, forwarding the packets out the appropriate ports and answers broadcast packets by proxy for all known addresses without forwarding any of the packets down the VLANs, thereby freeing the VLAN bandwidth from excessive traffic. The system requires no user configuration because the switching methodology is self-adaptive to the network in which it is inserted and has the ability to perform router functions such as level 2 and 3 switching, spanning tree protocols and compatibility with Internetwork Packet and Internetwork Packet Exchange networks.","d3f:kb-author":"Ballard C.
