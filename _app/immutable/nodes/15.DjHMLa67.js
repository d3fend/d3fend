    for a model that can precisely specify cybersecurity countermeasure
    components and capabilities. Furthermore, it is necessary that practitioners
    know not only what threats a capability claims to address, but specifically <i>how</i> those threats are addressed from an engineering perspective, and under what
    circumstances the solution would work. This knowledge is essential to estimate
    operational applicability, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop enterprise
    solutions comprising multiple capabilities.</p> <p>To address this recurring need in the near-term, we created D3FEND, a
    framework in which we encode a countermeasure knowledge base, but more
    specifically, a knowledge graph. The graph contains semantically rigorous
    types and relations that define both the key concepts in the cybersecurity
    countermeasure domain and the relations necessary to link those concepts to
    each other. We ground each of the concepts and relations to particular
    references in the cybersecurity literature.</p> <figure class="svelte-11nd4j6"><img class=" svelte-11nd4j6" alt="att&amp;ck and d3fend" src="/img/attack-defend.png"/> <figcaption>Simplified Offensive and Defensive Technique Relationships</figcaption></figure> <p>Numerous sources of research and development literature, to include a
    targeted sample of over 500 countermeasure patents from the U.S. Patent
    Office from the years 2001 to 2018, served as the source material to build
    this knowledge graph. To demonstrate the value of this approach in practice,
    the graph supports queries that can inferentially map cybersecurity
    countermeasures to offensive tactics, techniques, and procedures. Our
    longer-term vision is to leverage the <i>linked open data</i> available on research
    literature and apply machine learning, in particular semi-supervised methods,
    to assist in maintaining the D3FEND knowledge graph over time. Finally, we welcome
    community feedback on D3FEND.</p> <h2>Research Funding</h2> <p>This research was funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the National
